# Privacy Policy

*Note: Please be aware that only our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy in English are legally binding. While translations of these documents may be provided for your convenience, they are translated by the community and are thus not legal documents.*

This Terms of Service document applies to the official instance of Artismaga, available at [artismaga.com](https://artismaga.com). Self-hosted instances may choose to adopt this document if they wish.

### **Introduction**

We understand that legal documents can be overwhelming and boring, so we've tried our best to keep it as simple as possible while providing the information needed. It is important however to remember that these terms are legally binding between yourself and us if you choose to use Artismaga, so please read them carefully before proceeding.

### Your Privacy

Your privacy is very important to us, and we will ensure your privacy is protected when using our services.

**Artismaga** is an open-source, federated project (source code is available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/artismaga)), and we respect our user's privacy while remaining transparent with our users. We only collect limited data from our users that is absolutely necessary.

- **Account Information**: We collect data from our users when they register for an account on Artismaga, such as: the registered e-mail address, hashed password, and chosen username.
- **User-Generated Media**: If you create or interact with user-generated media on Artismaga, we collect and store information about that media to provide the service.
- **Self-hosted instances**: Since self-hosted instances aren't operated by us, we cannot enforce our own Privacy Policy, Acceptable Usage Policy or Terms of Service there. Please visit self-hosted instances at your own discretion.

### Who is this information shared with?

We will NEVER sell your data to any third-parties, although we use certain service providers to process your data, such as:

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), provides us with DDoS mitigation and content delivery acceleration.
- [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com), provides us with cloud services to run the Artismaga backend and database.

*Law & Order: We may disclose your information to third parties only if such disclosure is absolutely necessary to comply with a valid legal process, protect any person from death or serious injury, prevent fraud or abuse, or protect our rights, property, safety and interest*.

### Our commitment to children's privacy

We follow [The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule), which requires online service providers to obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. This applies to every user of our platform, regardless of different consent laws in different countries. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years of age, we will immediately delete that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe that they have disclosed personal information to us, please contact us at [contact@artismaga.com](mailto:contact@artismaga.com).

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

As we keep improving our services, we may update our Privacy Policy in the future if needed. We will notify you of any changes made to our Privacy Policy by specifying the date.

You are advised to review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Such changes to our Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
